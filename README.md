# OrderingSystem---Dropping-Donuts
 You are required to build an online ordering system, for a popular donut shop called "Dropping Donuts". This new ordering system, is supposed to allow customers to create their own custom donuts, for their order, instead of selecting from a pre-defined range of donuts. All basic glazed donuts must have a base price of R4.00 per donut and any additional add-on is R2.00 extra. Every additional add-on must be tracked and be added to the total cost of the donut/order. Once a customer has selected all their desired add-ons, they need to be redirected to the payment page, which can display: the customerâ€™s username, all the add-ons of the donut they ordered, and the total price of their order.
